# Tasks

0. README and objectives!

In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

Page in Figma
fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

1. Header

Let’s start by the top: the header

Here the wireframe of it:

Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)
In the body, add an header tag
Inside this header:
Add a link element with an image inside
Add a block of 3 link elements

2. Banner

Now, the banner under the header:

Under the header, add a main element with inside it, a section element.

In this section element, add:

A block with inside it:
An heading tag (don’t forget to use the correct heading value)
A text element
A button tag
Another block with inside it:
Another heading tag (same, be careful about which one you are using)
A block containing 4 blocks - each block with inside:
An image
An heading tag
A text

3. Quote

Under the banner, we will add the quote block:

The quote section is inside the main:

Create a new section for the quote
Inside it, add a block containing:
An image
Another block with inside:
A quote tag
An author quote
A text

4. Videos

Let’s now add the videos list:

New section with inside it:

An heading tag
A block containing the 4 video block - each of them are composed with:
An image
An heading
A text
A block for the author:
A image
An heading
A block for the rating:
A block of images (one star = one image)
A text

5. Membership

Membership section is similar as the videos list:

After the videos list section, add a new section containing:

An heading
A block with inside 4 block item - each block defined with:
An image
An heading
A text
A button

6. FAQ

The FAQ section is ending the page before the footer:

Add a section for the FAQ with inside it:

A block that contains 2 “row block”
Each “row block” contains 2 “item block”
Each “item block” is composed of:
An heading
A text

7. Footer

And… the footer!

After the last section, outside of the main, add a footer:

A global block (used later for centering the footer content), inside this block:
A “row block” with:
An image
A block with inside:
Images with link
A text
And… that’s it for the moment - the result should not be shiny, don’t worry, CSS is coming…
